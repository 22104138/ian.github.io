        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p id="right-text" style="font-size: 24px; width: 760px">
          As the years went on, humanity has gone along and evolved on their
          technology. And with the rise of technology comes the rise of the
          different motherboards and their capabilities. To provide a short
          description to the motherboard, the motherboard is the largest
          electronic component in a computer that contains and connects most of
          the electronics (Schmidt, 2019). Back in 1981, the International
          Business Machines (IBM) released the original motherboard, along with
          the original Personal Computer (PC). It only had five expansion slots
          that could only handle 8 bits of information at the time, as opposed
          to the modern ATX motherboard that has 7 expansion slots (Jones et
          al., 2003). Knowing this, technology has long evolved during the years
          with motherboards being far faster and more advanced than when it was
          first made.

          <h5>DISCUSSION</h5>
          <p>
            With the vast and diverse knowledge about the different types of
            motherboards and their purpose, we can say that each motherboard has
            their own purpose. Whether when the user wants to make a computer
            that’s smaller in size and that’s cost effective then they can use a
            micro-ATX motherboard . If the user wants to build a standard
            computer system then they could opt for an ATX motherboard (Mueller,
            2003).
