          Hello! I am Ian Miguel C. Florentino, the creator and designer of this
          website! I just wanted to say, thank you very much for reading through
          my website. Originally, the idea of this website was taken from a web
          development project back in my grade 11 days. It was just a website
          that I created for fun and to showcase my interests at the time. At
          the time, me and my friends found it really funny that I named the
          website "Gwapito" and I guess it stayed as a memory between me and my
          friends. From time to time they would bring up the website when I
          would choose to be narcissistic like saying that I'm very handsome,
          then they'd bring up "Gwapito". Seeing a project that I made just for
          fun and laughter, now into a fully fledged website made with html and
          css. It really does bring me joy. It made me realize how far I've come
          despite all the hurdles that I've faced. It really did make me realize
          that life will always move on. I am proud. Not just of my website, but
          with myself as well. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention my likes. So
          mainly I like music, games, and food. The music I typically listen to
          are metal, rock, indie, shoegaze, electronic, and other songs that
          just sound good (I sometimes don't have a preference for genres). The
          games I mainly love are hotline miami 1 and 2 because the gameplay is
          super fun, Dark Souls 1 and 3 because the lore and worldbuilding is
          insanely good, and ultrakill because the gameplay is fast-paced and
          fun. For the food part, I mainly love eggs(although I'm allergic to
          them) and meat. Yep, that's pretty much it. Thank you so much for
          reading through a revived project of mine. I do hope this website can
          see you again.
