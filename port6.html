        <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
        <p id="right-text" style="font-size: 24px; width: 760px">
          Ever since the evolution of humanity’s technology. We’ve eventually
          made the computer for making much more complex calculations, and as we
          made more computers we made them much more technologically advanced
          when it comes to speed, efficiency, and power. Just like the very
          first supercomputers, it used to have a single CPU and could only have
          a peak performance of 3 million floating point operations per second
          (FLOPS). Now on average, a supercomputer can calculate 200 to more
          than 1000 million floating point numbers per second (Clark, 2011).

          <h5>DISCUSSION</h5>
          <p>
            Based on the table that is filled with data, there is a difference
            in use between the different types of computers. One example could
            be their purpose in calculating huge amounts of data. The
            supercomputer is best suited for the job because it was specifically
            designed to process and calculate large amounts of data because of
            the supercomputer’s speed and efficiency to calculate data with the
            help of parallel computing. Another user could have a need for
            having a small computer just for their individual wants or needs, in
            this case, the microcomputer is best suited for it because it is
            mainly used for surfing the internet, home entertainment, and word
            processing (Kanwal, 2024).
