        <h5>COMPUTER HARDWARE</h5>
        <p id="right-text" style="font-size: 27px">
          The name that we give to physical objects or electrical parts of a
          computer system is called Hardware. Hardware is physical so it can be
          touched and seen. Examples of Computer Hardware include the cables,
          transistors, peripherals, power units, and circuit boards (Cook et
          al., 2008).

        <h5>MOTHERBOARD</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          The Motherboard contains all the important computer hardware such as
          the Central Processing Unit, Random Access Memory and other important
          electrical parts. The Motherboard is used to connect the CPU to the
          memory so that basic functions such as input from the keyboard and
          output to the storage devices (Clements, 2006).

        <div class="left-text">
          <h5>CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT</h5>
          <p>
            The CPU or the processor is the most important part of the
            motherboard. It is made up of tons of millions of transistors that
            is located in one single chip. It is considered as the most
            important part because it performs actions from different
            applications and it processes data (James, 2013).

        <h5>RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          The Random Access Memory, also known as RAM, is a type of computer
          storage. Data stored can be accessed in any order in a worst case
          performance of time. This type of computer storage is volatile, so
          once the power is cut off from the computer, the data is immediately
          lost (Agarwal, 2020).

        <div class="left-text">
          <h5>SECONDARY STORAGE</h5>
          <p>
            The Secondary Storage, also known as, Auxilary Storage is used to
            store data permanently. This type of computer storage is
            non-volatile so when power is cut off, the data is still retained.
            There are three types of Secondary Storage, these include the Hard
            Disk Drive, the Solid Disk Drive, and the Optical Device (Wilson,
            2022).

          <h5>SYSTEM SOFTWARE</h5>
          <p id="right-text">
          System Software are responsible for managing and allocating memory for
          each application or program. Thus providing an environment where
          programs can be smoothly executed. It is also responsible for
          interacting with the hardware (Chattopadhyay, 2007).

        <h5>APPLICATION SOFTWARE</h5>
          <p>
            Application Software are programs that help users with their
            specific needs or tasks. The System Software carries out commands
            from the application, and the application carries out commands from
            the user. Examples of Application Software could be media players,
            word processors, and graphic software. Application Software can be a
            bundle such as Microsoft Office, where you don’t need to install
            individual applications (Sharma et al., n.d.).

        <div class="left-text">
          <h5>PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          Programming Software, also known as, Integrated Development
          Environment is a tool used for programmers that has a source code
          editor, a compiler or interpreter, build-automation tools, and a
          debugger. There are a variety of Integrated Development Software that
          caters to a specific user’s needs such as Visual Studio, Eclipse,
          Sublime Text, and many more (Kline & Seffah, 2005).

        <h5>HEALTHCARE</h5>
          <p>
            In this modern age, technology has evolved to the point where it can
            even help us in diagnosing patients, or let us use portable
            hand-held computer medical devices to assist with the data
            gathering. Hospitals also use databases like the Hospital
            Information System (HIS) to store their patient’s data such as their
            diagnosis, problems, or ailments. Medical Imaging has also helped
            doctors accurately figure out what’s internally wrong with a patient
            through x-rays that let the doctors see past the skin and into the
            patient’s organs (Egan & Liu, 1995).

          Learning Management Systems such as Ismis or Google Classroom are
          online educational platforms that provide an online experience for
          both the teacher and the students. It is used now by higher
          institutions in higher levels of education. Universities use Learning
          Management Systems because it provides them with tons of features that
          would, if otherwise done physically, would be inconvenient, such as
          giving assessments, course delivery, and admin functions (Kats, 2010).

          <p>
            Technology and computers have evolved long enough to also help our
            leaders with governance. Computers have also made data management,
            communication, and service delivery even more efficient and
            effective (Northrop, 1982).

        <p id="right-text">
          Ever since technology evolved, so has the different strategies for
          retailing. Retail has found ways to incorporate itself with
          technology, such as mobile promotion which can help businesses promote
          their own products through online marketing and advertisements.
          Technology has also made the process of paying for a product easier by
          using cards to pay or just scanning a QR code (Dash & Khandenwal,
          2019).

        <h5>LIBRARIES</h5>

            Technology has also found its way to into blending itself with
            libraries, making countless knowledge easily accessible with just a
            few taps. Library Management Systems (LMS) are software that can
            handle basic library housekeeping functions such as cataloguing,
            book loaning, and circulation control. These Library Management
            Systems have databases that consists of books, and is easily
            manageable since it is online (Sarma, 2016).

          Before I researched more about the following topics that include
          Hardware, Software, and their implementations in our society, I never
          really knew the actual and concrete definitions of both Hardware and
          Software. All the knowledge I had about Hardware and Software were
          based on observations that I had all through out the years. Now I know
          that main difference and the actual meaning of Hardware. It is the
          physical objects or electrical parts of a computer. I also never knew
          what the main electrical components of a computer were. All I knew was
          the CPU case, and the other peripherals. Now I know more about the
          electrical parts inside of the CPU casing such as the motherboard,
          which is the most important of them all because it connects all the
          necessary electrical hardware of a computer such as the Random Access
          Memory, and the Secondary Storage. The software also goes hand to hand
          with the hardware because without the software, the computer is just a
          bunch of useless objects that serve no purpose. I also know now that
          there are different software that govern our computer to do things and
          that helps us interact with the computer. The most important one being
          the System Software, also known as the Operating System of a computer.
          It's very important to have an Operating System because it's what
          helps connect the hardware to each other. One example is it connects
          the Central Processing Unit to another application, or it could
          connect an application to another application by allocating memory to
          those applications. It would be wasteful however if these systems were
          never put to use. There are a handful of institutions that have
          incorporated technology into their very own work. An example could be
          healthcare institutions using computers to accurately diagnose a
          patient, or to store data so that it would be easily accessed again.
          Another useful help by technology is that it helps doctors assess a
          patient by scanning their bodies for any potential or actual issues.
