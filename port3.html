        <h5>NUMBER SYSTEMS</h5>
        <p id="right-text" style="font-size: 24px">
          It is a well-structured system that represents or expresses a
          numerical value (Wahed, 2022). Computer Number Systems are the complex
          languages of a computer (Dewhurst, 1988). The representation of
          numbers or number systems are very important for computers so that
          they can maximize efficiency (Roy, 2023). A number system is a system
          that is used to express numbers (Islam et al., 2023). It is a
          representation of numbers used to create computer formats that improve
          the speed and efficiency of calculations (Inyutin, 2022).

        <h5>BINARY NUMBERS (BASE 2)</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          When Leibniz initially invented the Binary System, he originally
          wanted to solve mathematical problems that he had trouble with at the
          time (Strickland, 2022). The binary system, from the root word “bi”,
          means two and it has two numbers ‘0' and ’1' (Harris, 2017).

          <h5>OCTAL NUMBERS (BASE 8)</h5>
          <p>
            Octal Numbers, the number 8 is used to represent the base of the
            system. The digits used are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7. An advantage for
            Octal Numbers is that no new symbols are required so digits 8 and 9
            are unnecessary. Another possible reason for octal adoption is
            subitizing, the ability to instantly recognize a small number of
            objects without counting. The maximum number typically subitized is
            7, aligning with the octal system 0-7 but not with decimal 0-9
            (Plantz & Berman, 1971).

        <h5>DECIMAL NUMBERS (BASE 10)</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          The Decimal Number System contains 10 symbols which are: 0, 1, 2, 3,
          4, 5, 6, ,7, 8 and 9. This number system is also known as the Arabic
          Numerals. The human brain normally uses the decimal system because we
          also have 10 fingers, our brains are trained to think in the real
          world using decimal system (LaMeres, 2023b).

          <h5>HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS (BASE 16)</h5>
          <p>
            The hexadecimal system (hex) uses 16 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
            7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. In this system, the position of each
            digit determines its weight, which increases by a factor of 16 as
            you move from right to left in the number (Bolton, 2006). Leibniz
            also invented the Hexadecimal System (Base 16), he called it the
            “Sedecimal” and the “Sedenary” (Strickland, 2022).

        <h5>BINARY NUMBERS (BASE 2)</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          Binary numbers can be used to apply the set theory, and be used for
          databases (Yao et.al, 2006). Computers use binary because it has two
          stable states which is “on” or “off” (Yii, 1974b).

            In their study, they used the Octal Number System to improve their
            network security (Orhani & Çeko, 2023). This was also used in early
            mini computers (Kumar, 2016).

        <h5>DECIMAL NUMBERS (BASE 10)</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          Human kind has always been using the decimal number system because we
          have 10 fingers and we use them for arithmetic purposes (Bowring,
          1854).

            These are used for microprocessor work and is used to define the
            addresses of binary numbers stored in computer memory (Rajput,
            2006).

          Before going into Computer Science as a course, I did not know a thing
          about Computer Number Systems or Computer Number Representations. I
          only knew about the Binary Number System but I only knew it was
          composed of only two numbers which are zero and one. I never had any
          idea how to properly utilize or correctly convert binary numbers into
          another number system and vice versa. After researching more about the
          topic, I finally know about the number systems and the types of number
          systems. I never knew that Number Systems are a representation of
          numerical values that are expressed through symbols or digits. I did
          not even know about the different types of Computer Number Systems.
          Now I finally know and understand the different types of Computer
          Number Systems. Now I know that there are four main Computer Number
          Systems, which include: Binary Number System (also known as Base 2),
          Octal Number System (also known as Base 8), Decimal Number System
          (also known as Base 10), and lastly Hexadecimal Number System (which
          is also known as Base 16 or Sedecimal). The main difference between
          all of these Computer Number Systems is that they all have different
          bases or radix. Before learning and researching more about the topic,
          I never even knew the purpose or significance of each of these
          different Computer Number Systems. For the Binary Number System, it
          can be used to store data in a database, and apply the Set Theory. The
          computer also works because of the Binary Number System. Computers can
          only understand the Binary Number System because each of their logic
          circuits or transistors only have two stable states which are “on” or
          “off”. For the Octal Number System, it can be used for strengthening
          the network security. For the Decimal Number System, it is very
          important for all of us humans because we use that number system
          everyday. Lastly for the Hexadecimal Number System, it is used for
          specifying the addresses of binary numbers in a computer memory.
