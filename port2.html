        <h5>DATA</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          Data are basic numerical items that were results from observations,
          however these items don’t have any context (Zins, 2007). Data consists
          of patterns that have no meaning, they are the ingredients for the
          interpretation process (Aamodt & Nygård, 1995).

          <h5>INFORMATION</h5>
          <p>
            Information is the refined data that is has become useful for
            analysis (Liew, 2007). It is a particular fact or context that is
            told to someone (Buckland, 1991).

        <h5>DATA AND INFORMATION</h5>
        <p id="right-text">
          Data is raw, it only exists and has no other significance beyond its
          existence. It can exist in any shape or form but it does not contain
          any meaning. Meanwhile information is the data that has been given
          meaning by ways in relational context. This meaning can be useful but
          in other cases it could also not be useful (Bellinger et al., 2004).

          <h5>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h5>
          <p style="font-size: 24px">
            These information systems collect, store, analyze, and distribute
            data for a specific purpose. This purpose could be for business
            related reasons (Rainer et al., 2020). Its purpose is to give
            information to a person or a group need the information (Boaden &
            Lockett, 1991). Information systems are a crucial investment for any
            businesses in this age (Pearlson et al., 2024). These systems can
            create information based on the given date (Ultrich, 2001). These
            are network systems that provide services to the end-user (Westmark,
            2004).

          <h5>TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEM</h5>
          <p>
            The Transaction Processing System (TPS) is a system used in business
            to input, enter, store, and process the important details of a
            business event. After processing, the system will generate
            information to help assess the business. Because of this, the
            Transaction Processing System is best used for day-to-day operating
            routines (Rahmatian, 2002).

          <h5>MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM</h5>
          <p>
            Management Information Systems are used for understanding real world
            problems in business. The Management Information System is used for
            businesses to gain a competitive advantage, improve on decision
            making, and strengthen business processes (O’brien & Marakas, 2006).
            This system gets its data from the output of the TPS and then
            generates information after processing the data (Gupta, 2010).

          <h5>DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS</h5>
          <p>
            Decision Support Systems play a primary role for computers in the
            decision making process. This information system is primarily used
            by managers because this system generates insights about management
            problem solving to improve the effectiveness of the problem solving
            (Keen, 1980).

          <h5>EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM</h5>
          <p>
            The Executive Information System is a system used by executives to
            have easy access to both internal and external data that is
            imperative to their success. This information system is also very
            easy to use and navigate. Although even with its user-friendly
            interface, it can still have its important functions such as
            extracting, filtering and compressing important data (Watson et al.,
            1991).

      <h5>REACTION</h5>
      <div>
        <p>
          Before I was researching the definitions of data and information, I
          used to just assume that data and information were interchangeable but
          after researching about data and information, I finally know the
          difference between the two terms. I will no longer tell people about
          observations or facts while wrongly interchanging data and
          information. Before I even researched this, I never even knew about
          the different types of information systems. I only knew the four types
          of information systems and I only knew about the general idea of these
          information systems. Now I know about the different purposes and the
          different users of these information systems. I did not even know
          about the users or people who use these different kinds of information
          systems such as retail workers, managers and executives. For starters,
          I now know the main purpose of the Transaction Processing System is
          for lower level employees to handle day-to-day business transactions.
          The management information system is for managers to revitalize their
          business strategies and plans. As for the Decision Support System,
          this information system is usually used by upper management such as
          managers to help decide on their next course of action. This system
          helps them assess and improve on the capabilities and efficiency of
          their problem solving. Lastly for the Executive Information System,
          this information system is mainly used by those higher up on the chain
          of command such as executives in a company. This information system is
          built to be easy to navigate and easy to use while also maintaining
          its functionality to discern, compile, and process data and
          information. With this knowledge available to me, perhaps in the
          future I might be able to use this information to help me about the
          different information systems in the future company that I will be
          working with.
