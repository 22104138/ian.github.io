        <h5>COMPUTER SCIENCE AS A DISCIPLINE</h5>
        <p id="left-text">
          According to Denning et al. (1989), computer science as a discipline
          conforms to the tradition scientific methods and standards by
          incorporating the use of theory, experimentation and design. They also
          said that students can learn to be competent with their coding skills
          by learning more about the computer’s ins and outs.

          <h5>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h5>
          <p>
            Computer Science as a major involves topics such as Data Structures
            and Algorithms. It dwells in the theoretical aspects of computing.
            It involves writing programs, designing systems, and creating
            applications (Proulx et al., 1996).

          <h5>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h5>
          <p>
            Information Systems as a major involves analyzing, designing,
            implementing and maintaining information systems for businesses so
            that they can help with the decision making process and the
            day-to-day operations. Because of this, technology has been been
            even more integrated with more businesses (Bourgeois, 2014).

          <h5>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h5>
          <p>
            According to O’ Brien and Marakas (2006), they say that
            professionals in information technology are supposed to optimize the
            use of rare resources in a company or organization using information
            support to help them with the decision-making.

          <h5>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h5>
          <p>
            Computer Engineering as a major involves applying what they learned
            theoretically into actual real life applications. So they deal with
            both software and hardware. They have topics like the binary number
            system, hard disk and many more (Tokdemir and Cagiltay, 2010).

          <h5>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h5>
          <p>
            According Sommerville (2011), software engineering is a systematic
            collection of good practices and techniques to create applications.
            This involves learning efficient and cost-effective coding skills
            for software development.

        <p>
          Before I started learning about the computing disciplines and majors,
          and computer science as a discipline, I barely had any idea on what
          the difference was between all the majors such as Computer Science,
          Information Technology, Information Systems, Computer Engineering and
          Software Engineering. I also know how important computer science is as
          a discipline because it helps me understand the computer better, but
          not just on the surface level but on a deeper level. Learning about
          this certain discipline helped me realize that computer science is
          focused more on the theoretical side of computers like binary number
          systems, bits, and algorithms rather than the applications such as the
          maintenance for the software or the hardware aspects of it such as
          making robots or making the next generation chipsets. Although there
          is still some application like making a website, it is still focused
          on algorithms, data structures, and generally logic. Knowing this,
          undergoing computer science will be challenging but at least it will
          help me learn to be better and competent enough with my people and
          coding skills that I can endure and be successful in the tech
          industry. I also realized how there’s a huge difference between the
          different majors or disciplines. Although all of them involve the use
          of computers, there’s still a distinct difference between them such as
          their strengths and weaknesses. Take Computer Science and Computer
          Engineering for example, the difference between them is that Computer
          Science focuses more on the theoretical foundations of a computer
          while Computer Engineering focuses more on low level languages and
          hardware. As for Information Technology, this discipline is more of
          like an intersection between the two majors because it involves
          softwares but they also dwell on maintaining hardware. For Information
          Systems, it’s almost the same as Information Technology but the main
          purpose of Information Systems is to help businesses create systems
          that can help with the decision making process. Lastly, software
          engineering deals with software and programming. Although it doesn’t
          dwell too much into the theoretical aspects of a computer, it just
          deals with engineering software.
